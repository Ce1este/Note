# Mean Normalization

Mean normalization involves subtracting the average value for an input variable from the values for that input variable resulting in a new average value for the input variable of just zero. 

To implement both of these techniques, adjust your input values as shown in this formula:

$x_i := \dfrac{x_i - \mu_i}{s_i}$

Where $μ_i$ is the **average of all the values for feature (i)** and $s_i$ is **the range of values (max - min)**, 
or $s_i$ is the **standard deviation**(标准差).

Note that dividing by the range, or dividing by the standard deviation, give different results. 

The quizzes in this course use range - the programming exercises use standard deviation.

For example, if $x_i$ represents housing prices with a range of 100 to 2000 and a mean value of 1000, 
then, $x_i := \dfrac{price-1000}{1900}$ .
