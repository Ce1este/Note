# Normal Equation

Gradient descent gives one way of minimizing $J (\theta)$. 

Let’s discuss a second way of doing so, 
this time performing the minimization explicitly and without resorting to an iterative algorithm. 

In the "Normal Equation" method, we will minimize $J (\theta)$ by explicitly taking its derivatives with respect to the $θ_j$ ’s, 
and setting them to zero.

This allows us to find the optimum theta without iteration. 

The normal equation formula is given below:

$\theta=\left(X^{T} X\right)^{-1} X^{T} y$

There is **no need** to do feature scaling with the normal equation.

The following is a comparison of gradient descent and the normal equation:

| Gradient Descent           | Normal Equation                                |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Need to choose $\alpha$    | No need to choose $\alpha$                     |
| Needs many iterations      | No need to iterate                             |
| $O (kn^2)$                 | $O (n^3)$, need to calculate inverse of $X^TX$ |
| Works well when n is large | Slow if n is very large                        |

With the normal equation, computing the inversion has complexity $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$. 

So if we have a very large number of features, the normal equation will be slow. 

In practice, when **n exceeds 10,000** it might be a good time to go from a normal solution to an **iterative process**.


# Normal Equation Noninvertibility

When implementing the normal equation in octave we want to use the 'pinv' function rather than 'inv.' 

The 'pinv' function will give you a value of $\theta$ even if $X^TX$ is not invertible.

If $X^TX$ is non-invertible, the common causes might be having :
- **Redundant features**(特征冗余)

  where two features are very closely related (i.e. they are linearly dependent(线性相关))
- **Too many features** (e.g. m ≤ n). 

  In this case, delete some features or use "[[regularization]]".
